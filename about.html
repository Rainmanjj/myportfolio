                <p>You might have trouble finding me when I'm not on the clock. I like to stay busy and enjoy life! I have so many hobbies that it's hard for me to find time to enjoy them all. One of my all time favorites is rock climbing. A few others would be mountain biking, motorcycle riding, working on projects, and many others.</p>
                <p>When I get going on something I tend to dogadly work at it. I'm not sure if that's a good thing or not. I'm sure my girlfreind could let you know if it is or it isn't. That's just the way I've always been. At any rate I really enjoy life and try to live it to the fullest.</p>
                <p>What I'm looking for in a new job is a way to free up more time to do the things that I really enjoy if I'm being honest. I think that is what everyone wants and it's something that I beilive can be achived. I am an intellegent person with a good outlook and I can figure most obsticales that get in my way.</p>
