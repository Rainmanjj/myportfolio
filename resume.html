      <h1>Bradly M Seif</h1>
      <h2>Summary</h2>
      <h4>	I am an ambitious self-starter that is looking at changing careers. Software development and web design are very appealing to me for a few reasons. One, I am currently working as a cnc machinist this entails me writing my own programs to finish a particular job that I get in. There is a rigid layout to do this that is quite similar to web design. However if I make a mistake writing the program for a part (which does happen occasionally all be it not often thankfully) there is usually a big bang and a couple hundred bucks goes out the window. In coding however a link may not function properly which is a simple matter of correcting that line. Two, I'm looking for something that provides a new challenge for me on a reoccurring basis and there is always something to learn about coding. Three, I want a career that will allow me to enjoy my life more. In machining if you want to make good money that requires you to work overtime I'm not opposed to doing this once and a while but more and more in that field employees are expected to work 50+ hours a week. I am currently teaching myself html and css on codecademy and am happy to say that I'm picking it up quite easily.
